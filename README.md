## Overview

The inspiration for this application is rooted in a custom application that I needed to understand how to implement a color picker in Java. The results from following the tutorial from Awais has provided a great opportunity to continue working with JavaFX and the MVC pattern.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
 - Create a custom sized canvas
 - Change the brush size
 - Adjust the color using a color picker

## My process

### Built with

- Java
- JavaFX
  - XML

### What I learned

I learned how to use the Color Picker from JavaFX to draw on the Java Canvas, and got a little introduction to the MVC pattern. 

### Continued development

I would like to add more functionality to the application: 
- Different brush shapes
- A history of changes (undo, redo)
- Better UI

### Useful resources

- [Awais Mirza's Paint app tutorial](https://www.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ8KDf8eyBU) - This tutorial provided a good starting point to help with other projects
